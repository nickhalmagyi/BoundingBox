Get ALL points within a distance from source
sorted by distance

1. make_bounding_box(source, length_km)

2. filter targets to within box (targets)

3. compute distances for filtered points (targets_filtered)

4. sort points by distance

THEN

5. keep all points within distance
 


Get closest N-points


validate_N_spositive_integer()
validate_targets

if N >= len(targets): return targets

targets_filtered = []

while len(targets_filtered) < N or dist_to_Nth_pt > length_km

    1. make_bounding_box(source, length_km)
    
    2. filter targets to within box (targets)
    
    3. compute distances for filtered points (targets_filtered)
     
    4. sort points by distance

THEN

5. return closest N-points
